            <p>Hello Ife</p>
            <p><strong>Technology sucks!</strong></p>
            <p><em>A guy spent hours troubleshooting his Wi-Fi because it kept disconnecting every night at the same time. After days of frustration, he discovered the culprit: his neighbor's parrot. The bird had learned to mimic the “shut down” voice command from his smart assistant and would yell it every evening around 10 PM!</em></p>

            <section>
                <p><strong>This is the first paragraph:</strong> Dave, the IT guy, was testing a voice assistant in the office. He asked it, “Who’s the smartest person here?”</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p><em>This is the second paragraph:</em> The assistant paused and then replied, “Definitely not the guy who forgot to mute me during the board meeting last week.”</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>This is the third paragraph: The entire office burst out laughing while Dave turned red.</p>
